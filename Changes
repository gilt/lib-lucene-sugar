Few changes 

First of all, awesome work. Few suggested changes are below all are very minor.

1) In LuceneFieldHelper class, it should be   doc.add(new TextField(name, value.text, stored))(Line 74) for LuceneText instead of StringField
2) Testcase showing the index and search example
3) README.MD, minor typo's like "import import" repeated import. In the usage example, the StandardAnalyzer should be before WritableLuceneIndex traits else NPE
